        "faq.q1.answer": "Both spellings are correct and refer to the same card game. \"Blackjack\" (one word) is more common internationally. \"Black Jack\" (two words) is sometimes used. In our trainer, we use both variants as players search for both terms.",

        "faq.q2.answer": "Basic Strategy is the mathematically optimal way to play Blackjack. It was developed through computer analysis and tells you for every card combination whether to Hit, Stand, Double, or Split. With Basic Strategy, you reduce the casino's house edge to under 0.5% - one of the lowest of all casino games.",
        "faq.q3.question": "How does the Ace count in Blackjack?",
        "faq.q3.answer": "The Ace is the most flexible card in Blackjack: It can count as 1 or 11 points - whichever is better for your hand. For example, if you have an Ace and a 6, that counts as Soft 17 (Ace = 11). If you then draw an 8, the Ace automatically downgrades to 1, so you stay at 15 points instead of 25 (Bust).",
        "faq.q4.question": "When should I split?",
        "faq.q4.answer": "The two most important rules: Always split Aces and Eights, never split Tens and Fives. Splitting Aces gives you two chances at a Blackjack. Splitting Eights turns a weak 16 into two playable hands. Tens (value: 20) are already very strong, and Fives (value: 10) are better doubled.",
        "faq.q5.question": "What does \"Double Down\" mean?",
        "faq.q5.answer": "With Double Down, you double your bet and receive exactly one more card. Then you must stand. This option is especially profitable with 10 or 11 points when the dealer shows a weak card - you have good chances of a high final total.",
        "faq.q6.question": "Is the Blackjack Trainer free?",
        "faq.q6.answer": "Yes, our Blackjack Trainer is completely free. You can practice Basic Strategy unlimited and play Blackjack in game mode - without registration and without real money. It's a pure practice tool without gambling.",
        "faq.q7.question": "What's the difference between Soft Hand and Hard Hand?",
        "faq.q7.answer": "A Soft Hand contains an Ace counted as 11 (e.g., A+7 = Soft 18). You can draw more cards with less risk because the Ace can downgrade to 1 if needed. A Hard Hand has either no Ace or the Ace must count as 1. Hard Hands have real bust risk.",
        "faq.q8.question": "Should I take Insurance?",
        "faq.q8.answer": "No. Insurance is offered when the dealer shows an Ace. It pays 2:1 if the dealer has Blackjack. Mathematically, you lose money long-term with this side bet - the house edge is over 7%. Basic Strategy recommends: Never take Insurance.",
        "faq.q9.question": "Can I guarantee wins with Basic Strategy?",
        "faq.q9.answer": "No, even with perfect Basic Strategy you won't win every hand. Blackjack remains a game of chance. However, Basic Strategy minimizes the house edge to about 0.5%. That means: Short-term anything is possible, but long-term you lose on average only 50 cents per €100 wagered - one of the fairest values of all casino games.",
        "faq.q10.question": "How can I best learn Basic Strategy?",
        "faq.q10.answer": "The most effective way is in three steps: First Hard Hands, then Soft Hands, then Pairs (Splits). Use our training mode, which gives you instant feedback after every decision. 15-20 minutes of daily practice over 1-2 weeks is usually enough to internalize the strategy.",
